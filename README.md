## Module Synopsis

The module explores the possibilities of data and multimedia for gathering news, producing and distributing it. This includes but is not limited to: Computer Assisted Reporting (CAR); data journalism; mapping and geotagging; mashups; audio and podcasts; audio slideshows; online video; interactivity and image maps.

Students will be introduced to a range of data and multimedia tools and techniques and use these to report on newsworthy stories. The project is student-led and so class time will be increasingly devoted to peer feedback and individual guidance, engaging with guest practitioners and case studies.

## Rationale

The Data and Multimedia Journalism module contributes to the overall programme philosophy and aims by enabling students to engage directly in the news process and develop a critical understanding of the possibilities of a particular type of technology in newsgathering, production and distribution. Students will develop a strong sense of their professional development needs, be involved in creating networks of speciality and will demonstrate an action orientated approach.

## Aims

1. Demonstrate a critical understanding of new forms of newsgathering, production and distribution
2. Initiate and develop innovative and experimental approaches to telling stories and engaging users
3. Identify and develop networks of learning and interest
 
## Audio and video skills sessions 

If you wish to pursue multimedia skills further you should also attend sessions available from Caroline Officer which have been distributed on the general Moodle including:

* Audio editing and production sessions
* Video editing and production sessions
* NTI Future Media sessions - please ask Caroline or NTI for details
* There are sometimes additional sessions in broadcast skills with Diane Kemp and Bob Calver, and other media - please ask your tutor.

## Week by week outline 

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures. 

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.
