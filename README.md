## Module Synopsis

The module explores the possibilities of data and multimedia for gathering news, producing and distributing it. This includes but is not limited to: Computer Assisted Reporting (CAR); data journalism; mapping and geotagging; mashups; audio and podcasts; audio slideshows; online video; interactivity and image maps.

Students will be introduced to a range of data and multimedia tools and techniques and use these to report on newsworthy stories. The project is student-led and so class time will be increasingly devoted to peer feedback and individual guidance, engaging with guest practitioners and case studies.

## Rationale

Within the context of the increasing use of data within media organisations, Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’ and communities of practice, that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques. The module provides practical skills within a range of conceptual frameworks applicable to the production practice routes of the award. It also provides a basis for the successful completion of the Master’s route project, and introduces potential avenues of practice-based inquiry for routes into PhD progression beyond. 

The module begins by building applied understanding of data journalism techniques and issues, before exploring more specific practices around design, analysis and interactivity. These are closely aligned to the core assignment tasks. A range of newsgathering and storytelling techniques are explored, giving the student the basis for initiating and developing contemporary data journalism projects within a professional context.

These techniques include core media production skills required for developing the basis for a masters level dissertation/ practical project. A mixed methods pedagogical approach is adopted, with lectures combined with hands-on workshops where students are supported in developing and reflecting on their own work within a contemporary context. 

Work in this module links to the different core semester two modules and Work Placement module

##  Learning outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2. Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project
 
## Week by week outline 

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures. 

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.
